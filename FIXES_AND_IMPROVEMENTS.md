## 🏷️ EXIF Tags in Images

  - "MAL Downloader" in `TAG_ARTIST`
  - Adult content marking in `TAG_COPYRIGHT` for hentai content

**Technical Implementation:**

**Features:**

## 📁 Genre-Based Folder Organization

**✅ IMPLEMENTED**
- Complete restructure of folder organization system
- Folders now organized by content type and genres as requested:

**Folder Structure:**
```
MAL_Export/
├── Anime/
│   └── [Primary_Genre]/
│       └── anime_title_id.jpg
├── Manga/
│   └── Anime Manga/
│       └── [Primary_Genre]/
│           └── manga_title_id.jpg
└── Hentai/
    ├── Anime Hentai/
    │   └── [Primary_Genre]/
    └── Hentai Manga/
        └── [Primary_Genre]/
```

**Smart Classification:**
- Detects hentai content from genres or title keywords
- Creates "Anime Manga" subfolder for regular manga
- Creates "Hentai Manga" for adult manga content
- Uses primary genre as final subfolder level
- Sanitizes folder names to prevent filesystem issues
